# Getting Started
To execute the app, follow these steps:

1. Run the commands below in the terminal:
    ```
    flutter pub get
    flutter run
    ```
    This will install necessary dependencies and initiate the app on a connected device or emulator.

## Testing

```
flutter test
```
This will run the complete suite of unit and widget tests.

## Building
